Discussion:

Following technologies were used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript ES6 syntax. I used standard XMLHttpRequest syntax in “Quote machine2” app. As a bonus, I used “AXIOS JS” library to great Ajax request in “Weather app”.

Requirements:

“Weather app” help you to check weather for today or for the next five days. It uses real https://openweathermap.org API. As a desire location you can type desire city or you can use “Geolocation API from google” – connection between API, your browser and application are scripted.

“Quote machine” is modification on FreeCodeCamp home task. I used https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com to create Ajax request.
